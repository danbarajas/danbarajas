# Welcome!
Hi! I'm Daniel Barajas, a computer scientist focused on functionality, creative design, user experience, and finding the delicate balance of all three.

I'm one of the lucky few to discover my career passion at an early age. Ever since my family got our first computer, I couldn't help but explore everything it could do. Starting in elementary school, I became fascinated with teaching myself advanced computer concepts. So much so that my middle school computer teacher noticed my fixation and personally referred me to Codecademy, introducing me to the world of programming. I've gone on to teach myself an array of programming techniques throughout high school and am thrilled to be taking my passion to the next level at UIC. I can't wait to continue growing and saying "Hello, world!" to more projects and opportunities.
